In LangChain, data ingestion is the process of preparing external data so it can be 
effectively used by large language models for tasks like question answering and retrieval-augmented generation. 
It begins with collecting data from various sources such as PDFs, text files, databases, 
or web pages through document loaders, after which the data is broken down into smaller, 
manageable chunks using text splitters since LLMs cannot handle very large documents directly. 
These chunks are then converted into embeddings using models like OpenAI or HuggingFace, which 
represent the semantic meaning of the text in numerical form. The embeddings are stored in vector 
databases such as FAISS, Pinecone, or Chroma, enabling efficient similarity search. Later, when a user 
poses a query, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks based on semantic similarity and provides 
them to the LLM, ensuring accurate, context-aware, and meaningful responses.
